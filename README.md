# Automation in Irrigation using IoT
The project consists of hardware circuit which has an
ESP8266 microcontroller connected with DHT11 and Capacitive Soil Moisture sensors. Both of these sensors are
relatively inexpensive and provide fairly accurate values. The
ESP8266 microcontroller also known as Node MCU is useful
for enabling WiFi connectivity. Users can easily connect to the
Node MCU via their mobile phone. Similarly they can connect
their computer to the phone WiFi and hence data exchange and
communication will be facilitated. As the data recorded from
the sensors is stored in locally hosted database there is no
additional cost to the user. The third party analytics service
that is used in this project i.e. ThingSpeak limits the free
tier version of its service to 3 million messages per year and
message update interval time to 15 seconds. The feature of
downloading sensor data into a CSV format requires MS Excel
or any other application that can read file stored in this format.
